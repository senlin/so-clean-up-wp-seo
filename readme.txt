Clean up several things that the WordPress SEO plugin adds to your WordPress Dashboard

== Description ==

Almost anyone that uses WordPress SEO by Team Yoast will agree that it is *the* SEO plugin, but the developers are adding more and more unwanted things to the WordPress Dashboard.

The purpose of the SO Clean Up WP SEO is to clean up all those unwanted things.

As per the current release, the plugin removes and/or disables the following unwanted items:

* removes sidebar ads on all WordPress SEO settings pages
* removes the WordPress SEO dashboard widget
* removes the WordPress SEO settings from the Admin Bar
* globally sets plugin-tour to done and plugin about-page as seen
* removes the keyword/description columns on edit Posts/Pages pages

We support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-clean-up-wp-seo/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.
